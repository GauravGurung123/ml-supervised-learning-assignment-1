    "## 🧮 Exercise 2 – k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) Classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Objective\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to implement and evaluate a **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)** classifier using the **Iris dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.\n",
    "The classifier predicts the class of new examples by identifying the *k* closest labeled examples in the training set using Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Tasks Overview\n",
    "1. **Dataset Preparation**\n",
    "   - Load the Iris dataset.\n",
    "   - Split it randomly into training (70 %) and test (30 %) subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **k-NN Implementation**\n",
    "   - For a new test example, compute its Euclidean distance to all training examples.\n",
    "   - Select the *k* nearest neighbors and use majority voting to predict its class.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Compare classifier accuracy for k = 3, 7, 11.\n",
    "   - Repeat 30 times with different random splits.\n",
    "   - Display results using a boxplot with whiskers.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Confusion Matrix**\n",
    "   - Plot the confusion matrix of one representative run for each value of *k*.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Analysis Question**\n",
    "   - Explain why *k* is usually chosen as an **odd number** when the number of classes is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Tools Used\n",
    "- **pandas** for dataset management\n",
    "- **numpy** for numeric operations\n",
    "- **matplotlib** for visualizations\n",

    "### ✅ Discussion and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧾 Summary of Results\n",
    "- As *k* increases, the classifier becomes smoother (less variance) but may lose sensitivity to local patterns.\n",
    "- Lower values of *k* (like 3) can achieve slightly higher accuracy but may be more affected by noise.\n",
    "- The overall performance across 30 runs is consistent and high (> 0.9 accuracy for all tested *k* values).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Observations\n",
    "- The boxplots confirm that different *k* values produce similar accuracy, with small variability.\n",
    "- Confusion matrices show clear class separations for **Iris-setosa** and small confusion between **versicolor** and **virginica**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 Conclusions\n",
    "1. The k-NN algorithm is simple yet powerful for small, well-structured datasets like Iris.\n",
    "2. Proper choice of *k* controls the trade-off between overfitting (low *k*) and underfitting (high *k*).\n",
    "3. Repeated random splits provide a more reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚀 Future Improvements\n",
    "- Apply feature scaling (normalization) to improve distance computation consistency.\n",
    "- Use cross-validation instead of random splitting for more robust accuracy estimation.\n",
    "- Extend the experiment to multi-dimensional datasets or higher values of *k* to study asymptotic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrates the intuition behind **instance-based learning** and how the choice of neighborhood size affects classification performance.\n"
