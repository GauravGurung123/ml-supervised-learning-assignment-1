    "## 🧮 Exercise 3 – Naïve Bayes Classifier (Iris Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Objective\n",
    "In this exercise, we implement a **Naïve Bayes classifier** using the **Iris dataset**, applying probability theory to predict the class of each example.\n",
    "The Naïve Bayes method assumes that all features are independent given the class, allowing for efficient computation of conditional probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 Tasks Overview\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "   - Load the Iris dataset and discretize all numerical columns into three categories: **low**, **medium**, and **high**.\n",
    "   - Split the dataset randomly into 70 % training and 30 % testing subsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Naïve Bayes Implementation**\n",
    "   - Estimate prior probabilities *P(Class)* for each class.\n",
    "   - Estimate conditional probabilities *P(Xᵢ | Class)* from the training data.\n",
    "   - For each test instance, compute *P(Class | X)* using Bayes’ theorem and choose the class with the highest probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Repeat 30 random train/test splits.\n",
    "   - Compute accuracy and display a confusion matrix for one representative run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comparison**\n",
    "   - Compare performance with the k-NN classifier (Exercise 2) and discuss advantages/disadvantages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ Tools Used\n",
    "- **pandas** for data manipulation\n",
    "- **numpy** for numeric calculations\n",
    "- **matplotlib** for visualizations\n",
    "- **sklearn.metrics** for evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is written manually to reinforce understanding of probabilistic reasoning before using automated libraries.\n"

    "### ✅ Discussion and Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧾 Summary of Results\n",
    "- As *k* increases, the classifier becomes smoother (less variance) but may lose sensitivity to local patterns.\n",
    "- Lower values of *k* (like 3) can achieve slightly higher accuracy but may be more affected by noise.\n",
    "- The overall performance across 30 runs is consistent and high (> 0.9 accuracy for all tested *k* values).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 📊 Observations\n",
    "- The boxplots confirm that different *k* values produce similar accuracy, with small variability.\n",
    "- Confusion matrices show clear class separations for **Iris-setosa** and small confusion between **versicolor** and **virginica**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔍 Conclusions\n",
    "1. The k-NN algorithm is simple yet powerful for small, well-structured datasets like Iris.\n",
    "2. Proper choice of *k* controls the trade-off between overfitting (low *k*) and underfitting (high *k*).\n",
    "3. Repeated random splits provide a more reliable estimate of model performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🚀 Future Improvements\n",
    "- Apply feature scaling (normalization) to improve distance computation consistency.\n",
    "- Use cross-validation instead of random splitting for more robust accuracy estimation.\n",
    "- Extend the experiment to multi-dimensional datasets or higher values of *k* to study asymptotic behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise demonstrates the intuition behind **instance-based learning** and how the choice of neighborhood size affects classification performance.\n"
